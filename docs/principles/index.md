# 2. Principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure 

*Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep
intact your roots.*\
*--* *Victor Hugo*

Over the years, the CERT/CC has identified a number of principles that
guide our efforts in coordinating vulnerability disclosures and which
seem to be present in many successful CVD programs.

These principles include the following:

-   [2.1. Reduce Harm](2_1)
-   [2.2. Presume Benevolence](2_2)
-   [2.3. Avoid Surprise](2_3)
-   [2.4. Incentivize Desired
    Behavior](2_4)
-   [2.5. Ethical
    Considerations](2_5)
-   [2.6. Process Improvement](2_6)
-   [2.7. CVD as a Wicked
    Problem](2_7)\
