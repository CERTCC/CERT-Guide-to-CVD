Over the years, the CERT/CC has identified a number of principles that
guide our efforts in coordinating vulnerability disclosures and which
seem to be present in many successful CVD programs.

These principles include the following:

-   [2.1. Reduce Harm](2.1.-Reduce-Harm_47677451.html)
-   [2.2. Presume Benevolence](2.2.-Presume-Benevolence_47677452.html)
-   [2.3. Avoid Surprise](2.3.-Avoid-Surprise_47677453.html)
-   [2.4. Incentivize Desired
    Behavior](2.4.-Incentivize-Desired-Behavior_47677454.html)
-   [2.5. Ethical
    Considerations](2.5.-Ethical-Considerations_47677455.html)
-   [2.6. Process Improvement](2.6.-Process-Improvement_47677456.html)
-   [2.7. CVD as a Wicked
    Problem](2.7.-CVD-as-a-Wicked-Problem_47677457.html)\
