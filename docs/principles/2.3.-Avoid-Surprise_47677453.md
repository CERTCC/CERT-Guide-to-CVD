As with most situations in which multiple parties are engaged in a
potentially stressful and contentious negotiation, surprise tends to
increase the risk of a negative outcome. The importance of clearly
communicating expectations across all parties involved in a CVD process
cannot be overemphasized.

If we expect cooperation between all parties and stakeholders, we should
do our best to match their expectations of being \"in the loop\" and
minimize their surprise. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability without
coordinating first can result in panic and an aversion to future
cooperation from vendors and finders alike.

CVD promotes continued cooperation and increases the likelihood that
future vulnerabilities will also be addressed and remedied.
