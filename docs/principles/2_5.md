# Ethical Considerations 

At present, there is no generally accepted set of ethical guidelines for
CVD. In the security response arena, work toward defining ethical
guidelines is ongoing. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams
(FIRST) has established a special interest group to develop a code of
ethics for its member teams and liaisons \[1\]. However, that does not
imply that there is a complete absence of relevant guidance in the
matter. Here we highlight some ethics advice from related sources.

# Ethics in Related Professional Societies
Various computing-related professional societies have established their
own codes of ethics. Each of these has application to CVD. The
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct \[2\] includes the following general imperatives:

-   Contribute to society and human well-being.
-   Avoid harm to others.
-   Be honest and trustworthy.
-   Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
-   Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.
-   Give proper credit for intellectual property.
-   Respect the privacy of others.
-   Honor confidentiality.

The Usenix System Administrators' Code of Ethics \[3\] includes an
ethical responsibility "to make decisions consistent with the safety,
privacy, and well-being of my community and the public, and to disclose
promptly factors that might pose unexamined risks or dangers."

# Journalism Ethics
In many ways, disclosing a vulnerability can be thought of as a form of
journalistic reporting, in that "The purpose of journalism is ... to
provide citizens with the information they need to make the best
possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their
societies, and their governments" \[4\].

By analogy, vulnerability disclosure provides individuals and
organizations with the information they need to make the best possible
decisions about their products, their computing systems and networks,
and the security of their information.

We find the four major principles offered by The Society of Professional
Journalists Code of Ethics to be relevant to CVD as well \[5\]:

-   **Seek truth and report it** -- Ethical journalism should be
    accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in
    gathering, reporting and interpreting information.
-   **Minimize harm** -- Ethical journalism treats sources, subjects,
    colleagues and members of the public as human beings deserving of
    respect.
-   **Act independently** -- The highest and primary obligation of
    ethical journalism is to serve the public.
-   **Be accountable and transparent** -- Ethical journalism means
    taking responsibility for one's work and explaining one's
    decisions to the public.
