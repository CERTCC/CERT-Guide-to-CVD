# Presume Benevolence 

Benevolence refers to the morally valuable character trait or virtue of
being inclined to act to benefit others. In terms of the CVD process, we
have found that it is usually best to assume that any individual who has
taken the time and effort to reach out to a vendor or a coordinator to
report an issue is likely benevolent and sincerely wishes to reduce the
risk posed by the vulnerability. While each reporter may have secondary
motives (such as those listed in Table 1 below), and may even be
difficult to work with at times, allowing negative associations about a
CVD participants' motives to accumulate can color your language and
discussions with them.

This isn't to say you should maintain your belief that researcher is
acting in good faith when presented with evidence to the contrary.
Rather, one should keep in mind that participants are working toward a
common goal: reducing the harm caused by deployed insecure systems. I Am
the Cavalry describes Finder/Reporter motivations thus \[1\]:


|  Finder / Reporter Motivation   | Description |
|:------------------------------:|-------------|
|             Protect             | make the world a safer place. These researchers are drawn to problems where they feel they can make a difference. |
|             Puzzle              | tinker out of curiosity. This type of researcher is typically a hobbyist and is driven to understand how things work. |
|            Prestige             | seek pride and notability. These researchers often want to be the best, or very well known for their work. |
|             Profit              | to earn money. These researchers trade on their skills as a primary or secondary income. |
|            Politics             | ideological and principled. These researchers, whether patriots or protestors, strongly support or oppose causes. |





The Awareness and Adoption Group within the NTIA Multistakeholder
Process for Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities \[2\] surveyed security
researchers and vendors, finding that \[3\]:

-   92% of researchers participate in some form of CVD.
-   70% of researchers expected regular communication from the vendor
    about their report. Frustrated expectations were often cited as the
    reason for abandoning the CVD process
-   60% of researchers cited threat of legal action as a reason they
    might not work with a vendor to disclose
-   15% of researchers expected a bounty in return for their disclosure
