Anyone who becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not appear to have
been remediated should report the vulnerability to the vendor. One
should not assume that a vendor is aware of a specific vulnerability
unless it has already been publicly reported, whether by the vendor or
elsewhere. The easier it is to report vulnerabilities to a vendor, the
less likely that the vendor will be surprised by vulnerability reports
disclosed directly to the public.

# Advice for Reporters {#id-4.2Reporting-AdviceforReporters}

## Finding Vendor Contacts {#id-4.2Reporting-FindingVendorContacts}

Making initial contact with a vendor can sometimes be more difficult
than it should be. Here is a list of techniques we\'ve used to figure
out how to reach a vendor we\'ve never spoken with before.

### Common Methods {#id-4.2Reporting-CommonMethods}

-   Search the web or the vendor\'s web site for relevant phrases
    -   \"report a vulnerability\"
    -   \"security\"
    -   \"report a bug\"
    -   \"bug bounty\"
    -   \"vulnerability disclosure policy\"
    -   \"security@\" + company name
    -   company name + \"PSIRT\"
-   See if the vendor has a `security.txt` file, often found at
    `www.example.com/.well_known/security.txt` or sometimes
    at `www.example.com/security.txt`
    ([securitytxt.org](https://securitytxt.org/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"} , [IETF
    Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-09){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"})
-   Check vulnerability disclosure / bug bounty service providers
    ([BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, [Synack](https://www.synack.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, etc.) to find vendor contacts.
-   Check the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)
    member directory
    at [https://www.first.org/members/teams/](https://www.first.org/members/teams/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}
-   Check the CVE Numbering Authority list
    at [https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html#cna_participants](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html#cna_participants){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}
-   Search open source code repositories
    ([Github](https://www.github.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, etc.) to find developer contacts.
    -   If no direct contact information can be found, posting to the
        Issues page of a project asking how they\'d like to receive
        vulnerability reports can be useful.
-   Submit a bug report through the vendor\'s online bug tracker\
    -   If given the option to mark it as security-related, please do so
        as this often restricts viewing to just the vendor.
-   Reach out through social media
    ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){.external-link
    rel="nofollow"}, etc.) to request the vendor establish a direct
    communication channel \
    -   We recommend you avoid posting vulnerability details in public
        when making initial contact when possible. For example,
        reporters might instead post an issue to a public bug tracker
        requesting that the vendor provide a secure method of
        communication instead of just posting the vulnerability details
        directly in a publicly visible issue.
-   Try emailing commonly used addresses: 
    -   support@, security@, abuse@, info@, sales@
-   Fill out a generic support or \"Contact Us\" form
-   Make a phone call to the vendor

### Less common, but occasionally useful {#id-4.2Reporting-Lesscommon,butoccasionallyuseful}

We have rarely had to resort to these techniques, but they have been
occasionally useful.

-   Send a fax (yes, we\'ve actually done this)
-   Send snail mail\[1\] to an executive 
    -   If you have access to resources like LexisNexis, you can often
        find the names of executives in technical roles as a starting
        point.
    -   If message delivery confirmation is desired, in the US you can
        send certified mail with signature verification. The recipient
        must sign to receive the mail, and you\'ll get a signed receipt
        back.

### When all that fails {#id-4.2Reporting-Whenallthatfails}

Some vendors remain unreachable even after a number of reasonable good
faith attempts to reach them---and by reasonable we mean considerably
less than exhausting the entire list above. Some vendors just do not
seem to want to be reached, and that is their prerogative. However, we
have found that experience is often the best teacher. When a vendor gets
surprised by the publication of a vulnerability in their product and it
is clear from the report that attempts to notify them were made but
failed, it can prompt the vendor to re-evaluate their vulnerability
intake and handling processes to make it easier to reach them in the
future.

## Providing Useful Information {#id-4.2Reporting-ProvidingUsefulInformation}

Reporting a vulnerability requires that the vulnerability is
well-documented. This typically means providing the following
information:

-   The exact product version(s) affected

-   A description of how the vulnerability was discovered (including
    what tools were used) or what you were doing when you encountered
    the vulnerability

-   Proof of concept (PoC) code or reproduction instructions
    demonstrating how the vulnerability might be exploited

-   Ideally, a suggested patch or remediation action if the reporter is
    aware of how to fix the vulnerability

-   Description of the impact of the vulnerability and attack scenario
    (Kymberlee Price discusses the importance of providing a clear
    attack scenario in her article \[2\]).

-   Any time constraints (for example, give a date of publication or
    presentation at a conference if you know)

Reporters that do not provide enough information to a vendor or
coordinator may find their reports delayed or even rejected. Using CWE
\[3\] or CAPEC \[4\] as a reference might be helpful to describe the
type of vulnerability you have found and common ways to fix it the
problem.\
\
An example of a template for a vulnerability report, based on the
CERT/CC\'s own Vulnerability Reporting Form (VRF) \[5\], is provided
in [Appendix
D](/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CVD&title=Appendix+D+%E2%80%93+Sample+Vulnerability+Disclosure+Document&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=47677468){.createlink}.
Vendors that require additional information to validate reports should
clearly document their specific requirements in their vulnerability
disclosure policy, reporting form, or process description.

# Advice for Vendors {#id-4.2Reporting-AdviceforVendors}

Vendors need a mechanism to receive vulnerability reports from others.
This reporting mechanism should be easy enough to use that it encourages
rather than discourages reports. It can be as simple as a dedicated
email address for reporting security issues, a secure web form, or a bug
bounty program. Aside from the technical aspects of encouraging
reporting, vendors can also provide reporters with other incentives, as
discussed
in [Section ](2.4.-Incentivize-Desired-Behavior_47677454.html)[2.4](2.4.-Incentivize-Desired-Behavior_47677454.html).

## Create Secure Channels for Reporting {#id-4.2Reporting-CreateSecureChannelsforReporting}

Whether you are a vendor or a coordinator, you need to have open
channels for communication with vulnerability finders and reporters. In
our experience, the most common means of communication is email. For
this reason, the CERT/CC recommends that vendors establish a specific
and well-publicized email alias such as \<security@example.com\> solely
for receipt of vulnerability reports.

However, since email is an insecure communications channel by default,
many vendors, reporters, and coordinators prefer to use encrypted mail
instead. Although x.509 encrypted mail exists, we have found
PGP-compatible tools such as GnuPG to be more widely used by CVD
participants. Vendors are encouraged to create and publish a PGP key
affiliated with the security email alias to allow the confidentiality of
sensitive reports to be maintained in transit. 

Alternatively, some vendors choose to offer a web form specifically for
receiving reports of security-related issues. Such forms can then
deliver the report directly to your security or engineering team. The
CERT/CC discourages reliance on general \"Contact Us\" web forms that
pass through an organization\'s communications or customer support
teams. Many finders will balk at having to get past these nontechnical
interfaces into the vendor. In addition, security messages often must be
triaged and processed differently than other incoming contacts.

Another possibility is to make use of a third-party bug bounty or
coordination platform. For more information on common CVD tools, see
[Section 7](7.-Operational-Considerations_47677492.html).

## Reduce Friction in the Reporting Process {#id-4.2Reporting-ReduceFrictionintheReportingProcess}

As a vendor, it is important to not treat reporters with suspicion or
hostility. It\'s likely they have important information about your
product, and they want to share it with you.\
Furthermore, vendors should take care not to frustrate reporters\'
attempts to make contact by building too many assumptions into their CVD
process.

In the course of our own vulnerability coordination efforts, we have
observed all of the following erroneous assumptions built into vendor\'s
CVD process:

-   *The vendor and the reporter are engaged in a binding two-way
    negotiation. *-- This is false for at least two reasons: First, the
    reporter noticed an observable fact about a product flaw, and
    they\'re free to tell whomever they please. Similarly, the vendor is
    not obliged to keep the reporter in the loop once the report is
    received. And while it might be possible to eventually constrain the
    reporter or vendor contractually, that\'s not a foregone conclusion
    at the outset. Secondly, there exist adversaries who are entirely
    indifferent to whatever reporter-vendor agreements about disclosure
    might be reached, so even the most strictly binding agreement
    between vendor and reporter can be rendered irrelevant by events
    beyond either party\'s control.
-   *The reporter is always a customer or has a customer ID.* -- At the
    CERT/CC, we have hit walls in our communication attempts when a
    vendor\'s technical support function refuses to help us without a
    customer ID number. Be sure your tech support staff understand how
    to forward vulnerability reports to the appropriate individuals or
    groups within the organization. Vulnerability reports can arrive
    from anyone.
-   *The reporter is willing and/or able to fill out a web form.* --
    Some reporters prefer to use anonymous email; be sure you have more
    communication lines open than just a web form.
-   *The reporter is a human.* -- Sometimes reports can be
    auto-generated by tools. Include a clearly defined reporting format
    for tools if at all possible.
-   *The reporter can send or receive encrypted mail.* -- The CERT/CC
    encourages encrypted mail when possible, but it is not appropriate
    to presume all reporters can or must use encrypted mail. If the
    reporter declines to use encrypted mail, offer other options. These
    may include encrypted zip files or a company upload service such as
    FTP.
-   *The reporter has an account on your private portal.* -- The
    reporter may not be a customer with a portal account; furthermore,
    the reporter may wish to remain anonymous and will be unwilling to
    register for a portal account. Again, be sure it is easy for
    reporters to find more than one communication channel.
-   *The reporter will wait indefinitely for your reply before
    communicating with others about what they know.* -- Technology
    sometimes fails, and we wonder if a message was received. It is
    helpful to let the reporter know as soon as possible that the report
    was received. Give regular updates on the process so that the
    reporter is involved and there is mutual understanding. If reporters
    are kept out of the loop, they may seek out a third-party
    coordinator or even publish their report without notice.
-   *The reporter will keep your correspondence private.* -- Lack of
    response or rudeness on the part of a vendor may result in the
    reporter choosing to post the correspondence publicly. In addition
    to the negative attention this draws to the vendor and reporter
    alike, such negative experiences may discourage finders and
    reporters from reporting vulnerabilities to the vendor in the
    future.
