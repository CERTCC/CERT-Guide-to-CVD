*Sometimes it seems as if there are more solutions than problems. On
closer scrutiny, it turns out that many of today\'s problems are a
result of yesterday\'s solutions.*\

Although we have attempted to describe CVD as thoroughly as we can,
there are a number of open problems in CVD. In this chapter, we cover
two major topic areas that the CERT/CC has been working on in recent
years.

First, we discuss the increasing difficulty in identifying
vulnerabilities.

Second, we\'ll cover the changes that IoT implies to CVD now and for the
foreseeable future.
