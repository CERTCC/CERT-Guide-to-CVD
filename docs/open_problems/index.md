# Open Problems in CVD

Although we have attempted to describe CVD as thoroughly as we can, there are a number of open problems in CVD.
In this section, we cover two major topic areas that the CERT/CC has been working on in recent years.

First, we discuss the increasing difficulty in identifying vulnerabilities.

Second, we'll cover the changes that IoT implies to CVD now and for the foreseeable future.
