# The CERT&reg; Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

!!! tip inline end "Original Report"

    The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure was originally published as
    [CMU/SEI-2017-SR-022](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=503330)

    This web version is an evolution of that original report.

This is the web edition of *The CERTÂ® Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability
Disclosure*. We started with the original report in its entirety and
have been working to make it more accessible and easier to navigate.
We're also in the process of revising the guide based on feedback we've received
since its original publication.

!!! abstract "What is *The CERT Guide to CVD* about?"

    Security vulnerabilities remain a problem for vendors and deployers of
    software-based systems alike. Vendors play a key role by providing fixes
    for vulnerabilities, but they have no monopoly on the ability to
    discover vulnerabilities in their products and services. Knowledge of
    those vulnerabilities can increase adversarial advantage if deployers
    are left without recourse to remediate the risks they pose. Coordinated
    Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is the process of gathering information
    from vulnerability finders, coordinating the sharing of that information
    between relevant stakeholders, and disclosing the existence of software
    vulnerabilities and their mitigations to various stakeholders including
    the public. The CERT Coordination Center has been coordinating the
    disclosure of software vulnerabilities since its inception in 1988. This
    documentation is intended to serve as a guide to those who want to initiate,
    develop, or improve their own CVD capability. In it, the reader will
    find an overview of key principles underlying the CVD process, a survey
    of CVD stakeholders and their roles, and a description of CVD process
    phases, as well as advice concerning operational considerations and
    problems that may arise in the provision of CVD and related services.
