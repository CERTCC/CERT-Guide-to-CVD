*What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are entirely
different things.*\
*-- Margaret Mead*

Certain roles are critical to the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
process, as described below:

-   **Finder (Discoverer)** -- the individual or organization that
    identifies the vulnerability
-   **Reporter** -- the individual or organization that notifies the
    vendor of the vulnerability
-   **Vendor** -- the individual or organization that created or
    maintains the product that is vulnerable
-   **Deployer** -- the individual or organization that must deploy a
    patch or take other remediation action
-   **Coordinator** -- an individual or organization that facilitates
    the coordinated response process

Although a more detailed description of the CVD process is provided in
Section 4, a simple sketch of the relationships between these roles is
shown in Figure 1.

*Figure 1:* *CVD Role Relationships*

It is possible and often the case that individuals and organizations
play multiple roles. For example, a cloud service provider might act as
both vendor and deployer, while a researcher might act as both finder
and reporter. A vendor may also be both a deployer and a coordinator. In
fact, the CERT/CC has played all five roles over time, although not
usually simultaneously.
