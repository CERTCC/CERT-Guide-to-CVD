# Reporter 

The defining characteristic of vulnerability *reporters* is that they
originate the message that informs a vendor or coordinator of a
vulnerability. In most cases, the *reporter* is also the *finder* of the
vulnerability. However, this is not always the case. For example, the
finder might be an employee at an organization that also has in-house
vulnerability coordinators who act as the communications liaison with
the affected vendor(s).


Alternatively, it could be that someone analyzing a piece of malware
realized that it exploited a previously undisclosed vulnerability. In
both cases, the party communicating the vulnerability information to the
vendor is not the original finder. That said, whether or not the
reporter is the original finder is often not as relevant as whether the
newly provided information is sufficient to determine the existence and
impact of the problem reported.
