# 3.5. Coordinator 








Complicated or complex CVD cases can often benefit from the help of a
coordinator. A coordinator acts as a relay or information broker between
other stakeholders. Several types of coordinators with slightly
different roles and domains exist. We list a few here.

# Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) {#id-3.5.Coordinator-ComputerSecurityIncidentResponseTeam(CSIRT)}

[A Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is a service
organization that is responsible for receiving, reviewing, and
responding to computer security incident reports and activity. Their
services are usually performed for a defined constituency that could be
a parent entity such as a corporate, governmental, or educational
organization; a region or country; a research network; or a paid client.
A CSIRT can be a formalized team or an ad-hoc team. A formalized team
performs incident response work as its major job function. An ad-hoc
team is called together during an ongoing computer security incident or
to respond to an incident when the need arises

# CSIRT with National Responsibility {#id-3.5.Coordinator-CSIRTwithNationalResponsibility}

[CSIRTs with National Responsibility, also known as, National CSIRTs,
are designated by a country or economy to have specific responsibilities
in cyber protection for the country or economy. A National CSIRT can be
inside or outside of government, but must be specifically recognized by
the government as having responsibility in the country or economy \[2\].
In addition to functioning as a clearing house for incident response
across government departments and agencies, CSIRTs with National
Responsibility often have some degree of responsibility or oversight for
coordinating vulnerability response across their nation\'s critical
infrastructure. US-CERT, part of the Department of Homeland Security,
has been designated as the national CSIRT for the United States. We
maintain a list of National CSIRTS on the CERT website
\[3\].]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}

# Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) {#id-3.5.Coordinator-ProductSecurityIncidentResponseTeam(PSIRT)}

[Over time, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) have
emerged as a specialized form of CSIRT, allowing vendors to focus their
response to product security issues. Although not all vendors have
dedicated PSIRTs, vulnerability response is sufficiently different from
security incident response that larger vendor organizations can usually
justify having a distinct function to deal with it. PSIRTs usually
provide an interface to the outside world to receive vulnerability
reports as well as serving as a central coordinator between internal
departments for the organization\'s vulnerability response for its
products. When reporting a vulnerability to a vendor, the reporter will
usually be communicating with the vendor\'s PSIRT. For example, Cisco,
Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, and others have established
internal PSIRTs. Many PSIRTs participate in the Forum for Incident
Response and Security Teams
\[4\].]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}

# Security Research Organizations {#id-3.5.Coordinator-SecurityResearchOrganizations}

Organizations that perform security research on other vendors\' products
in the course of their own business sometimes establish their own
coordination capability in order to handle the disclosure process for
the vulnerabilities they find. A wide variety of organizations perform
this kind of security research, whether for profit or for non-commercial
reasons. Some examples include managed security service providers,
government agencies, and academic research teams. Some of these
organizations are vendors of products or services themselves, and
combine their PSIRT\'s vulnerability response capability with their
externally facing coordination capability.Â 

Furthermore, organizations that provide vulnerability management and
scanning tools and services are often well-positioned to act as a
disclosure coordinator for the vulnerabilities their products detect.
This applies especially when those vulnerabilities have not already been
disclosed to either the vendor or the public. Alternatively,
organizations such as these may choose to partner with another
coordinating organization in order to promote transparency and reduce
the perception of bias in their vulnerability disclosure process.

# Bug Bounties and Commercial Brokers {#id-3.5.Coordinator-BugBountiesandCommercialBrokers}

[In recent years, a new class of coordinator has emerged in the form of
commercial bug bounty program providers. Many individual vendors have
established programs to compensate security researchers for their
efforts in discovering vulnerabilities in the vendor\'s products.
Creation of a bug bounty program has been noted as an indicator of
maturity in vendors\' vulnerability response efforts. In some cases,
vendor bug bounty programs are enabled by other companies that provide
tools and services to facilitate vulnerability coordination. Companies
such as BugCrowd \[5\], HackerOne \[6\], Synack \[7\], and Cobalt \[8\]
offer turnkey solutions for vendors who want to bootstrap their own
vulnerability response program.\
\
While bug bounty programs help address the vulnerability coordination
needs of individual vendors, there still are vulnerabilities that
require larger scale coordination. In particular, multivendor
coordination remains a challenge for many organizations. As individual
vendors have become more mature in their handling of vulnerabilities in
their products, the role of multivendor coordination has increased in
importance for more traditional vulnerability coordinators such as the
CERT/CC \[9\], NCSC-NL \[10\], NCSC-FI \[11\], and JPCERT/CC
\[12\]]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}.

# Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) and Centers (ISACs) {#id-3.5.Coordinator-InformationSharingandAnalysisOrganizations(ISAOs)andCenters(ISACs)}

[Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) and Centers
(ISACs) are non-government entities that serve various roles in
gathering, analyzing, and disseminating critical infrastructure
cybersecurity information across private sector organizations of various
sizes and capabilities \[13,14\]. These organizations have only begun to
emerge in earnest within the past few years, but they are already
actively involved in the coordination and deployment of vulnerability
mitigations. Furthermore, it seems likely that some number of critical
infrastructure sectors will need to become involved further in the
coordination of the vulnerability discovery, disclosure, and remediation
processes.]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}

# Reasons to Engage a Coordinator {#id-3.5.Coordinator-ReasonstoEngageaCoordinator}

There are a number of reasons that a finder, reporter, or vendor may
wish to engage a third-party coordinator to assist with the CVD process.

## Reporter Inexperience {#id-3.5.Coordinator-ReporterInexperience}

Novice reporters sometimes request assistance from coordinators to
increase the chances of a successful resolution to the vulnerability
they have found. Working with a coordinator for the first few cases can
help develop a reporter\'s knowledge of the CVD process. From the
coordinator\'s perspective, working with novice reporters serves to
transfer knowledge of CVD to the security research community, thereby
improving vulnerability response overall. We have found that novice
reporters usually learn quickly and are willing to do most of the
coordination effort themselves, but just need occasional advice on how
the process should work.

## Reporter Capacity {#id-3.5.Coordinator-ReporterCapacity}

Seeing a CVD case through to resolution can at times be a protracted
process. Not all reporters have the time or resources to follow up on
vulnerabilities they\'ve reported. In such situations, a coordinator can
help by offloading some of the effort. However, coordinators are often
limited in their capacity as well, and must accordingly prioritize the
cases they choose to take on. As a result, coordinators and reporters
alike should take care to set clear expectations with each other as to
what roles they expect to play in any given coordination case.

## Multiple Vendors Involved {#id-3.5.Coordinator-MultipleVendorsInvolved}

At its most effective, CVD follows the supply chain affected by the
vulnerability. As a mental model, it can be useful to think of the
supply chain as horizontal or vertical. A horizontal supply chain
implies that many vendors need to independently make changes to their
products in order to fix a vulnerability. A vertical supply chain
implies that one vendor might originate the fix, but many other vendors
may need to update their products after the original fix is available.
Software libraries tend to have vertical supply chains. Protocol
implementations often have horizontal supply chains.

We discuss horizontal and vertical supply chains in [Section
5.4](5.4-Multiparty-CVD_47677477.md) below.

## CVD Disputes {#id-3.5.Coordinator-CVDDisputes}

Occasionally vendors and reporters have difficulty arriving at a
mutually acceptable response to the existence of a vulnerability.

Disputes can arise for many reasons, including the following:

-   Whether the behavior described in the report is reproducible
-   Whether the behavior described in the report has security
    implications
-   The impact of the vulnerability to deployed systems
-   Whether to publicly disclose the vulnerability
-   How much detail to include in a public disclosure
-   The timing of public disclosure
-   Whether extensions should be made to deadlines set by one party or
    another, whether or not they have been mutually agreed to previously

In these situations, and many others, reporters and/or vendors may find
it useful to engage the services of a third-party coordinator to assist
with conflict resolution. Drawing on the experience and relative
neutrality of a third-party coordinator can often dissipate some of the
potential animosity that can arise in contentious cases.

## Major Infrastructure Impacts {#id-3.5.Coordinator-MajorInfrastructureImpacts}

In situations where a vulnerability has the potential for major impact
to critical infrastructure, it may be necessary to coordinate not only
with vendors to fix the vulnerable products, but also with major
deployers. The primary concern in these cases is to ensure that internet
and other critical infrastructure remains available so that deployers
and other network defenders can acquire and deploy the necessary
information and patches.

Luckily this scenario is rare, but we have seen it come up in cases
affecting internet routing, the Domain Name System (DNS), internet
protocols, and the like. Vulnerabilities that affect basic Internet
services such as DNS (which also serves as an example of a horizontal
supply chain) affect a massive number of vendors; a coordinator can help
contact and disseminate information to vendors, service providers, and
other critical organizations for quick remediation.
