# Deployer

The *deployer* role refers to the individual or organization responsible
for the fielded systems that use or otherwise depend on products with
vulnerabilities.

Deployers include the following:

- network and cloud infrastructure providers
- outsourced IT operations
- in-house IT operations
- individual users

Deployers typically must take some action in response to a vulnerability
in a product they've deployed. Most often this means deploying a patch,
but it can also involve the application of security controls, such as
reconfiguring defensive systems, adding monitoring or detection rules,
or applying mitigations.

Automation of the deployment process increases the efficiency of the
deployer's response at the same time it decreases the duration of the
risk posed by vulnerable systems.
Although the deployer role is primarily concerned with Vulnerability
Management practices that sit downstream of CVD, it's worth spending a
few moments to understand how it fits in with CVD.
