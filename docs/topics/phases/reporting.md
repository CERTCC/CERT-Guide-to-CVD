# Reporting

Anyone who becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not appear to have
been remediated should report the vulnerability to the vendor. One
should not assume that a vendor is aware of a specific vulnerability
unless it has already been publicly reported, whether by the vendor or
elsewhere. The easier it is to report vulnerabilities to a vendor, the
less likely that the vendor will be surprised by vulnerability reports
disclosed directly to the public.

!!! tip "Advice for Vendors"

    Vendors need a mechanism to receive vulnerability reports from others.
    This reporting mechanism should be easy enough to use that it encourages
    rather than discourages reports. It can be as simple as a dedicated
    email address for reporting security issues, a secure web form, or a bug
    bounty program. Aside from the technical aspects of encouraging
    reporting, vendors can also provide reporters with other [incentives](../principles/incentivize_behavior.md).

!!! info "Report Template"

    An example of a template for a vulnerability report, based on the
    CERT/CC's own [Vulnerability Reporting Form](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/report/) (VRF), is provided
    in the [References](../../reference/simple_vrf.md) section.
    Vendors that require additional information to validate reports should
    clearly document their specific requirements in their vulnerability
    disclosure policy, reporting form, or process description.
