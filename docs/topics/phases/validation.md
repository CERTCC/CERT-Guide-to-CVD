# Report Validation

Vulnerability reports received from potentially unknown sources may hold
inaccurate information. One of the first tasks for the receiver of a
report is to analyze the report's validity. A vulnerability report is
basically an assertion that some set of conditions exists that permits
an adversary to take some action in support of a goal. But just because
it was reported doesn't make it true. Replication of the salient claims
made in the report is an important step in the case handling process.
