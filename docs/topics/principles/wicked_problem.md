# CVD is a Wicked Problem

!!! question "What is a Wicked Problem?"

    The term *wicked problem* was first introduced by Horst Rittel and
    Melvin Webber in 1973. The term was used to describe a class of
    social system problems that are ill-formulated, where the information
    is confusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with
    conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system
    are thoroughly confusing. The term *wicked* is used, not in the sense
    of evil, but rather in the sense that these problems are tricky and
    difficult. <!--excerpt-start-->The term *wicked problem* is used to describe a problem that
    is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory,
    and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.<!--excerpt-end--> 

    For a broader discussion of wicked problems, see the Wikipedia
    article on [Wicked Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem).

Because of the complexity of coordinating vulnerability disclosure, we consider it a wicked problem.
The following table lists the characteristics of wicked problems.
Anyone familiar with the CVD process will likely recognize these characteristics
in both the individual cases and the overarching process itself.

| Characteristics of Wicked Problems | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1. No definitive formulation | solving the problem is analogous to understanding it. |
| 2. No stopping rule | the problem has no intrinsic criteria to indicate that a solution is sufficient; solutions depend rather on the planner deciding to stop planning. |
| 3. Not true-or-false, but good-or-bad | the judgement of a solution's fitness by parties involved will be filtered through their values and their predisposed ideology. |
| 4. No immediate and no ultimate test | solutions can have far-reaching and not always clear effects in both time and scope. |
| 5. One-shot operation | actions taken in response to the problem affect the options available to future solutions. |
| 6. No enumerable set of potential solutions | it is not possible to demonstrate that all possible solutions have been considered or even identified. |
| 7. Essentially unique | despite long lists of similarities between a current problem and a previous one, there always might be an additional distinguishing property that is of overriding importance. |
| 8. A symptom of another problem | every identified cause leads to a "higher level" problem of which the current problem is a symptom. |
| 9. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution | The way a problem is described influences the solutions proposed. |
| 10. The planner has no right to be wrong | The goal of a solution is not to find an ultimate truth about the world, rather it is to improve conditions for those who inhabit it. |
