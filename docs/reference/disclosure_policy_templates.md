Following are some resources that can help you create a disclosure policy:

- CISA provides a [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Template](https://www.cisa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy-template)
  for U.S. Federal Agencies. This template is also useful as a starting point for other organizations
  looking to establish a vulnerability disclosure policy.

- UK National Cyber Security Centre has a [policy template](https://github.com/ukncsc/Vulnerability-Disclosure) as part of their
  [Vulnerability Disclosure Toolkit](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/vulnerability-disclosure-toolkit)

- The [disclose.io](https://disclose.io/) [Policymaker](https://policymaker.disclose.io/policymaker/introduction) tool can help you create a policy that fits your organization's needs.

- CERT/CC has a set of [Disclosure Policy Templates](https://github.com/CERTCC/vulnerability_disclosure_policy_templates)

- [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) is a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies.

- [ENISA Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/vulnerability-disclosure) includes an annotated vulnerability disclosure policy template as an Annex.

- The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has published a
