# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Vulnerabilities reported to the CERT/CC will be disclosed to the public 45 days
after the initial report, regardless of the existence or availability of
patches or workarounds from affected vendors. Extenuating circumstances,
such as active exploitation, threats of an especially serious (or
trivial) nature, or situations that require changes to an established
standard may result in earlier or later disclosure. Disclosures made by
the CERT/CC will include credit to the reporter unless otherwise
requested by the reporter. We will apprise any affected vendors of our
publication plans and negotiate alternate publication schedules with the
affected vendors when required.

It is the goal of this policy to balance the need of the public to be
informed of security vulnerabilities with vendors' need for time to
respond effectively. The final determination of a publication schedule
will be based on the best interests of the community overall.

Vulnerabilities reported to us will be forwarded to the affected vendors
as soon as practical after we receive the report. The name and contact
information of the reporter will be forwarded to the affected vendors
unless otherwise requested by the reporter. We will advise the reporter
of significant changes in the status of any vulnerability he or she
reported to the extent possible without revealing information provided
to us in confidence.

Vulnerabilities will be disclosed in [Vulnerability Notes](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls).

Vulnerability reports for U.S. Government web sites will be forwarded
to [CISA](http://www.cisa.gov/) for coordination with the government.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="grid" markdown>

!!! question "Why not 30 days, or 15 days, or immediately?"

    We think that 45 days can be a pretty tough deadline for a large
    organization to meet. Making it shorter won't realistically help the
    problem. In the absence of evidence of exploitation, gratuitously
    announcing vulnerabilities may not be in the best interest of public
    safety.

!!! question "Wouldn't it be better to keep vulnerabilities quiet if there isn't a fix available?"

    Vulnerabilities are routinely discovered and disclosed,
    frequently before vendors have had a fair opportunity to provide a fix,
    and disclosure often includes working exploits. In our experience, if
    there is not responsible, qualified disclosure of vulnerability
    information then researchers, programmers, system administrators, and
    other IT professionals who discover vulnerabilities often feel they have
    no choice but to make the information public in an attempt to coerce
    vendors into addressing the problem.

!!! question "Will all vulnerabilities be disclosed within 45 days?"

    No. There may often be circumstances that will cause us to adjust
    our publication schedule. Threats that are especially serious or for
    which we have evidence of exploitation will likely cause us to shorten
    our release schedule. Threats that require _hard_ changes (changes to
    standards, changes to core operating system components) will cause us to
    extend our publication schedule. We may not publish every vulnerability
    that is reported to us.

!!! question "Will you surprise vendors with announcements of vulnerabilities?"

    No. Prior to public disclosure, we'll make a good faith effort
    to inform vendors of our intentions.

!!! question "If a vendor disagrees with your assessment of a problem, will that information be available?"

    Yes. We solicit and post authenticated vendor statements and
    reference relevant vendor information in vulnerability notes. We will
    not withhold vendor-supplied information simply because it disagrees
    with our assessment of the problem.

!!! question "Who gets the information prior to public disclosure?"

    Generally, we provide the information to anyone who can
    contribute to the solution and with whom we have a trusted relationship,
    including vendors (often including vendors whose products are not
    vulnerable), community experts, sponsors, and sites that are part of a
    national critical infrastructure, if we believe those sites to be at
    risk.

!!! question "Do you disclose every reported vulnerability?"

    No. We may, at our discretion, decline to coordinate or publish a
    vulnerability report. This decision is generally based on the scope and
    severity of the vulnerability and our ability to add value to the
    coordination and disclosure process. Whether or not we coordinate or
    publish, we recommend that the reporter make a good faith effort to
    notify and work directly with the affected vendor prior to public
    disclosure.
