!!! tip "How To Use These Templates"

    Organizations will likely find that some expectations do not apply to their
    situation based on the kind of stakeholder they are. In particular we anticipate
    that 
    [product vendors](../../topics/roles/vendor.md),
    [service providers](../../topics/roles/deployer.md),
    and 
    [coordinators](../../topics/roles/coordinator.md) will have related but
    distinct needs. Inclusion or exclusion of items from these templates into your
    organization's policy should be based on which combination of stakeholder roles
    you expect to play.

    Here's a checklist of tasks you should complete in order to make use of these
    templates.

    - [x] Review the content of the [Disclosure Policy Style Guide](./style_guide.md).
    - [x] Review the content of the [Reporters](./reporters.md) and [Receivers](./receivers.md) files.
    - [x] Select the policy expectation items you want to use.
    - [x] Adjust the recommendation strength (e.g., change some of the SHOULDs to MUSTs or MAYs to SHOULD NOTs etc.).
    - [x] Adjust the wording of the items to fit your organization's style or needs.
    - [x] Replace any KEYWORDS with an appropriate substitution (e.g., "45 days"
          instead of `SLC`").
    - [x] Construct a single policy document from the collected items.
    - [x] Add any needed introduction, boilerplate, or legal info to the document.
    - [x] Review the entire document for internal consistency and fix any
          contradictions.
    - [x] Review the document for external consistency with other organization policies,
          applicable laws, regulations, etc.
    - [x] Get approval for the policy and to publish the document from necessary decision makers
    - [x] Establish sufficient operational capability in order to provide the service(s) the policy commits you to offer.
    - [x] Publish the policy
