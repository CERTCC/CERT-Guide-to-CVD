!!! tip "Adjust to Your Needs"

    Organizations will likely find that some expectations do not apply to their
    situation based on the kind of stakeholder they are. In particular we anticipate
    that product vendors, service providers, and coordinators will have related but
    distinct needs. Inclusion or exclusion of items from these templates into your
    organization's policy should be based on which combination of stakeholder roles
    you expect to play.
    
    Organizations using these templates might

    - change some of the SHOULDs to MUSTs or MAYs to SHOULD NOTs etc.
    - add or remove items as needed
    - change the wording to fit their organization's style or needs
