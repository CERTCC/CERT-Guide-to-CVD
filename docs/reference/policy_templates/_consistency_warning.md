!!! warning "These examples are not internally consistent"

    Because these policy statements are meant to be remixed and adapted for
    different organizations and contexts, some of the policy points could
    conflict with or mutually exclude others.
    It's up to you to edit them into whatever you want your policy to say.
    Our hope is that this collection has enough breadth of coverage across issues that the
    words address most of what you might want a policy to cover.
