# 5.3 Two-Party CVD 

The simplest instance of CVD is when there are only two parties
involved: the finder of the vulnerability and the vendor who can fix the
software. In this case, many of the complexities that arise in
multiparty situations do not come into play.

That is not to say that two-party CVD is always straightforward or easy.
It can still be difficult for the finder of a vulnerability to make
contact with the vendor. It can sometimes be difficult for the vendor to
work with the finder toward a resolution.

Personalities, attitudes, expectations, assumptions, and egos all play a
part in the success or failure of even two-party CVD.
