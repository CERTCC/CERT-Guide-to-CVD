Problems can arise when the multiple parties involved in CVD function at
different operational tempos. In both the vertical and horizontal supply
chain cases discussed above, synchronized timing of disclosure to the
public can be difficult to coordinate. The originating vendor(s) will
usually want to release a patch announcement to the public as soon as it
is ready. This can, however, put users of downstream products at
increased risk. As a result, coordinators sometimes find it necessary to
make the difficult choice to withhold notification from a vendor in a
complicated multiparty disclosure case if that vendor cannot be trusted
to cooperate with the coordination effort.

# When One Party Wants to Release Early {#id-5.5ResponsePacingandSynchronization-WhenOnePartyWantstoReleaseEarly}

In a multiparty coordination scenario, some vendors may want to release
early to protect their customers. They have a good point: should Vendor
A\'s customers be kept vulnerable just because Vendor B is taking longer
to prepare its response? Yet an equally strong counterargument can be
made: should customers of Vendor B be exposed to additional risk because
Vendor A was faster at its vulnerability response process? There is no
single right answer to this dilemma. The best you can do is keep the
communication channels open and try to reduce the amount of surprise
among participants. Planning for contingencies can be a useful exercise
too---the focus of such a contingency should be how to respond if
information about the vulnerability got out before you were ready for
it.

# Communication Topology {#id-5.5ResponsePacingandSynchronization-CommunicationTopology}

The complexity of coordination problems increases rapidly as more
parties are involved in the coordination effort. Graph theory tells us
the number of participant pairs increases as N(N-1)/2 for N
participants. As a result, multiparty coordination using point-to-point
communications do not scale well. Borrowing from communication network
concepts, multiparty coordination involving more than a few participants
can be improved with a shift to either a hub-and-spoke or shared-bus
topology in lieu of a full mesh or collection of point-to-point
communications (see Figure 2).\

\
The CERT/CC has historically applied a hub-and-spoke approach to
coordination for cases where it was feasible to maintain separate
conversations with the affected parties. Maintaining a hub-and-spoke
coordination topology for each distinct case requires some forethought
into tools and practices, though---you can\'t just carbon-copy
everybody, and without good tracking tools, keeping tabs on who knows
what can be difficult. A hub-and-spoke topology allows a coordinator to
maintain operational security since each conversation has only two
participants: the coordinator and the other party. The tradeoff is that
the coordinator (hub) can easily become a bottleneck during especially
active coordination situations.

Some of the larger coordination efforts we have encountered have
required more of a shared-bus approach through the use of conference
calls, group meetings, and private mailing lists. This approach puts the
CVD participants in direct contact with each other rather than having a
coordinator acting as a proxy for all communications while minimizing
the communication overhead. A shared-bus approach can increase the
efficiency of communications, but can on occasion make it harder to
reach agreement on what is to be done.

# Motivating Synchronized Release {#id-5.5ResponsePacingandSynchronization-MotivatingSynchronizedRelease}

[CVD process discussions tend to focus on the handling of individual
vulnerability cases rather than the social fabric surrounding
vulnerability coordination we construct over time. Shifting away from
the individual units of work to the social structure can suggest a way
out of some of the more contentious points in any given case.\
\
We previously described the multiparty delay problem. Game theory
provides us with the prisoners\' dilemma as model for thinking about
this concern. The main takeaway from research into the prisoners\'
dilemma is that by shifting one\'s perspective to considering a repeated
game, it\'s possible to find better solutions than would be possible in
a one-shot game with no history. The recognition that it\'s a repeated
game leads to improved cooperation among players who would otherwise be
motivated to act solely in their own self-interest in each round \[1\].\
\
One approach we\'ve found to work is to remind the parties involved that
this will likely not be the last multiparty vulnerability coordination
effort in which they find themselves. A vendor that repeatedly releases
early will likely get left out of future coordination efforts. Because
of this, the quicker vendors might be motivated to delay so they get the
vulnerability information the next time. Perhaps most important for
those wanting to release early is to remember that this is a repeated
game; you might be first one ready to publish this time but that may not
always be the case. Consideration for the other parties involved in any
given case can yield better outcomes in the long run.\
\
In the end, everyone benefits from vendors improving their vulnerability
response processes, so helping the laggards become more efficient can
sometimes become a secondary goal of the coordination
process.]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}[\
