We explore a number of principles of Coordinated Vulnerability
Disclosure in [Section
2](2.-Principles-of-Coordinated-Vulnerability-Disclosure_47677450.md).
{== TODO fixme [Section 3](3.-Roles-in-CVD_47677459.md) ==} describes the various roles
involved in CVD. Common phases of the CVD process are covered in
{== TODO fixme [Section 4](4.-Phases-of-CVD_47677466.md) ==}. The CVD process can vary
depending on multiple factors, which we discuss in [Section
5](5.-Process-Variation-Points_47677473.md). But things do not always
go smoothly, so {== TODO fixme [Section 6](6.-Troubleshooting-CVD_47677482.md) ==} offers
advice for troubleshooting the CVD process. [Section
7](7.-Operational-Considerations_47677492.md) highlights operational
considerations surrounding implementation of a CVD capability. In
{== TODO fixme [Section 8](8.-Open-Problems-in-CVD_47677496.md) ==}, we discuss a few
open issues in the CVD space. Our conclusion can be found in [Section
9](9.-Conclusion_47677499.md), followed by a
[bibliography](Bibliography_47677529.md) and multiple
[appendices](Appendices_49414192.md). The appendices contain
additional information about CVD issues specific to the [Internet of
Things](Appendix-A---On-the-Internet-of-Things-and-Vulnerability-Analysis_47677518.md),

used in CVD processes, as well as references to [disclosure
