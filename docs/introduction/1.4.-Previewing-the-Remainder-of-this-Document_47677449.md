We explore a number of principles of Coordinated Vulnerability
Disclosure in [Section
2](2.-Principles-of-Coordinated-Vulnerability-Disclosure_47677450.html).
[Section 3](3.-Roles-in-CVD_47677459.html) describes the various roles
involved in CVD. Common phases of the CVD process are covered in
[Section 4](4.-Phases-of-CVD_47677466.html). The CVD process can vary
depending on multiple factors, which we discuss in [Section
5](5.-Process-Variation-Points_47677473.html). But things do not always
go smoothly, so [Section 6](6.-Troubleshooting-CVD_47677482.html) offers
advice for troubleshooting the CVD process. [Section
7](7.-Operational-Considerations_47677492.html) highlights operational
considerations surrounding implementation of a CVD capability. In
[Section 8](8.-Open-Problems-in-CVD_47677496.html), we discuss a few
open issues in the CVD space. Our conclusion can be found in [Section
9](9.-Conclusion_47677499.html), followed by a
[bibliography](Bibliography_47677529.html) and multiple
[appendices](Appendices_49414192.html). The appendices contain
additional information about CVD issues specific to the [Internet of
Things](Appendix-A---On-the-Internet-of-Things-and-Vulnerability-Analysis_47677518.html),
[sample](/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CVD&title=Appendix+C+%E2%80%93+Sample+Vulnerability+Report+Form&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=47677449){.createlink}

used in CVD processes, as well as references to [disclosure
policies](/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CVD&title=Appendix+E+%E2%80%93+Disclosure+Policy+Templates&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=47677449){.createlink},
practices, and [related
information](Appendix-B---Traffic-Light-Protocol_47677521.html).
