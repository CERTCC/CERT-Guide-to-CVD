# Vulnerability

!!! abstract "Vulnerability"

    A *vulnerability* is a set of conditions or behaviors that allows the
    violation of an explicit or implicit security policy. 

Vulnerabilities
can be caused by software defects, configuration or design decisions,
unexpected interactions between systems, or environmental changes.
Successful exploitation of a vulnerability has technical and risk
impacts. Vulnerabilities can arise in information processing systems as
early as the design phase and as late as system deployment.

!!! quote "_Vulnerability_ in the NIST Glossary"

    NIST offers the following [definitions](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability) of vulnerability:

    1. "Weakness in an information system, system security procedures,
    internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or
    triggered by a threat source"
    1. "A weakness in a system, application, or network that is subject to
       exploitation or misuse"
    2. "Weakness in an information system, system security procedures,
       internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a
       threat source"


Those familiar with the [CERT Resiliency Management Model](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/cert-resilience-management-model-cert-rmm-collection/)
(RMM) may be accustomed to the more general definition of vulnerability in the
[Vulnerability Analysis and Resolution](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/vulnerability-analysis-and-resolution-var-cert-rmm-process-area/)
(VAR) process area: 

!!! quote "_Vulnerability_ in the CERT RMM"

    A vulnerability is the susceptibility of an asset and associated service to disruption.

A summary of the VAR process area of the CERT RMM is provided in our discussion
of [Vulnerability Management](vulnerability_management.md).

While vulnerabilities can be found in many assets belonging to an
organization&mdash;people, information, technology, and facilities&mdash;in this
documentation we primarily focus on vulnerabilities in software or
software-centric products and to a lesser degree services built on
software-dependent products.
While precisely defining vulnerability can
be difficult, for our purpose a vulnerability may be thought of as an
undesirable, exploitable, and likely unintended feature of software or
hardware components that allows an attacker to perform actions that
wouldn't otherwise be available to them. The impact of such
vulnerabilities can vary greatly, from being able to access someone's
private data, to taking control of a computer, to causing physical
damage and bodily injury.

!!! question "Why does CERT shorten _vulnerability_ to _vul_ instead of _vuln_?"

    Lots of folks ask us this question. The answer is simple: Tradition.
    We've been calling them _vuls_ (no _n_) since at least 1993, and we have the email archives to prove it.
    Considering how many times we've had to type it, we figure we've saved ourselves approximately a 
    gazillion keystrokes over the years.
    At this point, it's become a [shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth) for CERT/CC staff and alumni.
    You can start using it too, and instantly make your CVD practice _up to_ 25% more efficient!
