!!! tip "Vulnerability Discovery vs. Vulnerability Scanning"

    [*Vulnerability Discovery*](./vulnerability_discovery.md) is the process of finding new vulnerabilities in software or hardware.
    This is distinct from [*Vulnerability Scanning*](./vulnerability_scanning.md), which is the process of using automated tools to find _known_
    vulnerabilities in software or hardware.
    *Vulnerability scanning* is a useful tool for finding known vulnerabilities in a system as part of a 
    [*vulnerability management*](./vulnerability_management.md) program, but it is not a substitute for _vulnerability discovery_.
