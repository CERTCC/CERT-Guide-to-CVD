# Vulnerability Response (VR)

!!! abstract "Vulnerabilty Response (VR)"

    Vulnerability Response is the overall set of processes and
    practices that deal with the existence of vulnerabilities in systems. 
    VR encompasses everything from reducing the introduction of vulnerabilities
    as part of a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) through the remediation
    of deployed vulnerabilities via patch deployment.

    Below are a few resources for further reading on these topics:

    - [Threat Modeling](https://shostack.org/books/threat-modeling-book) is Adam Shostack's book on the subject.
    - [SEI CERT Coding Standards](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards) is a collection of coding standards from the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute.
    - [Cybersecurity Engineering Research: Security Engineering Risk Analysis (SERA) Collection](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/cybersecurity-engineering-research-security-engineering-risk-analysis-sera-collection/) is a collection of resources on the topic from the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute.

Vulnerability response in the design and development phases often takes
the form of practices such as Threat Modeling, Secure Coding, and Software
Engineering Risk Analysis.

However, such practices seem unlikely to ever completely eliminate vulnerabilities
from being introduced into released software and deployed systems. For
those vulnerabilities that do escape detection by these early lifecycle
practices, it remains necessary to plan for their eventual discovery and
disclosure. 

The goals of vulnerability response include the following:

- Limit attacker advantage over defenders.
- Reduce the population of vulnerable product instances as quickly as
    possible.
- Reduce the impact of attacks against vulnerable systems.

!!! tip "Incident Response vs. Vulnerability Response"

    Sometimes the term _Incident Response_ is used synonymously with
    _Vulnerability Response_. These two concepts are related, but different;
    _Vulnerability Response_ specifically indicates responding to reports of
    product vulnerabilities, usually via the CVD process, whereas _Incident
    Response_ is more general and can also include other security events such
    as network intrusions. We will generally stick to the _Vulnerability
    Response_ terminology since this work is specifically about CVD.
