# Vulnerability Scanning

!!! abstract "Vulnerability Scanning"

    *Vulnerability scanning* is the practice of using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks. 

Scanning tools compare the configuration of a system to a database of known vulnerabilities and generate a report of the findings.
Scanning tools can be used to identify vulnerabilities in a wide range of systems, including operating systems, applications, and network devices.
The results of a vulnerability scan can be used to prioritize remediation efforts and reduce the risk of exploitation by adversaries.
