# Vulnerability Discovery

!!! abstract "Vulnerability Discovery"

    Vulnerability Discovery refers to the process of searching for and
    finding previously unknown vulnerabilities in information processing systems.

Vulnerability discovery can take many forms, from specifically targeted
software testing to simple use of a system by a security-aware
individual who notices some feature that seems out of place. In order
for that discovery to be relevant to our discussion, it must result in a
vulnerability report. Most discussions about vulnerability disclosure
are referring to the handling of reports of newly discovered
vulnerabilities in products for which no patch exists

!!! question "So you mean *zero days*?"

    Colloquially, yes. But for a more nuanced discussion regarding why we're eschewing the term *zero-day
    vulnerability* here, see our blog post
