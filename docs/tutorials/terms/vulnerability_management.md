# Vulnerability Management (VM)


!!! abstract "Vulnerability Management (VM)"

    _Vulnerability Management_ is the common term for tasks such as
    vulnerability scanning, patch testing, and deployment. 

VM practices nearly always deal with the output of CVD practices, not the inputs. 
VM practices focus on the positive action of identifying specific systems
affected by known (post-disclosure) vulnerabilities and reducing the
risks they pose through the application of mitigations or remediation
such as patches or configuration changes. 
In other words, VM entails the identification of 
[*instances*](product_instances.md) of a [*product*](products_instances.md)
on which action must be taken to mitigate or remediate known vulnerabilities in the
product.
