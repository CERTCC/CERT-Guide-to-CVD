# Exploits, Malware, and Incidents

Any discussion of [*vulnerabilities*](vulnerability.md) would be incomplete without also discussing *exploits*, *malware*, and *incidents*.
These terms are closely related to vulnerabilities, but they are not the same thing.

!!! abstract "Exploit"

    An *exploit* is software that uses a [vulnerability](./vulnerability.md) to achieve some effect.
    Sometimes the effect is as simple as demonstrating the existence of the vulnerability. 
    Other times it plays a role in enabling adversaries to attack systems.

!!! abstract "Malware"

    *Malware* is software used by adversaries to compromise the security of a system or systems.
    Some malware involves exploits to achieve its goals, but not all malware involves exploits.

!!! abstract "Incident"

    An *incident* is a violation or an attempted violation of a security policy, and may involve malware, exploits, or
    vulnerabilities (or none of these!)
