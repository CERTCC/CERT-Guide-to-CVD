!!! warning "Vulnerability affects multiple vendors with incompatible disclosure policies"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter, Vendor, Coordinator

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation and prioritization, Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. Multiple vendors are likely to be affected by the vulnerability.
        2. At least one of those vendors has a policy or practice of disclosing vulnerabilities more quickly than others.
        3. That vendor is unwilling to adjust their behavior to accommodate slower vendors.

    - See also Vulnerability affects downstream vendors, 5.4 Multiparty CVD, 5.5 Response Pacing and Synchronization, and 5.6 Maintaining Pre-Disclosure Secrecy
    - The coordinating parties (Reporter, Vendor(s), and/or Coordinator) have three options:
        1. Shorten their embargo to accommodate the fast-moving vendor
        2. Delay notifying the the fast-moving vendor until the other vendors are close enough that they'll be ready for the Public Awareness phase at the same time as the fast-moving vendor
        3. Avoid notifying the fast-moving vendor during the embargo period, letting them catch up once the vulnerability enters the Public Awareness phase.
    - The third is nearly always the least optimal of the three choices.
