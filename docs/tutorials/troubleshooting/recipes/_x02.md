!!! warning "Evidence of exploitation for an embargoed report"

    !!! warning inline end ""
        
        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter
    
        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation and prioritization, Remediation
    
        **Description:**
    
        1. The vulnerability is still under embargo (i.e., the process has not reached the Public Awareness phase yet).
        2. Evidence indicates that the vulnerability is being used by attackers.

    - See 6.6 Active Exploitation
    - At this point, the embargo is effectively moot, and the Public Awareness phase has been entered regardless of whether the preceding phases have completed.
    - Vendors, Coordinators, and Reporters should always be ready to immediately terminate an embargo and go public with whatever advice is available at the time that evidence of exploitation becomes known.
    - The Vendor should accelerate their remediation development as much as possible.
    - Even a simple Vendor acknowledgement that the problem is being worked on can help deployers adjust their response accordingly.
