!!! warning "Vendor explicitly declines to take action on a report"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter

        **Phase(s):** Validation and Triage

        **Description:**

        1. The vendor has been given an opportunity to review the report
        2. The vendor informs the reporter of its decision not to take any further action

    - Assuming 
        - both conditions in the description have been met,
        - the validation and triage phase has concluded, and
        - the vendor has indicated that they will not be engaging in the remediation phase. 
    - The reporter's implied obligation to the vendor coordination process is effectively terminated at this point. 
    - If the reporter chooses to continue pursuing the issue at all, their options include:
        - The reporter may publish the report on their own.
        - The reporter may attempt to engage a coordinator
