    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation andprioritization, Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. The vendor had received the report.
        2. The vendor is working on it.
        3. Information about the vulnerability appears in public.

    - See 5.7 Disclosure Timing, 6.4 Intentional or Accidental Leaks, and 6.5 Independent Discovery
    - At this point, the embargo is effectively moot, and the Public Awareness phase is initiated regardless of whether the preceding phases have completed.
    - Vendors, Coordinators, and Reporters should always be ready to immediately terminate an embargo and go public with whatever advice is available at the time that the vulnerability becomes known.
    - The Vendor should accelerate their remediation development as much as possible.
    - Even a simple Vendor acknowledgement that the problem is being worked on can help deployers adjust their response accordingly.
    - The CERT/CC does not recommend punitive measures be taken against perceived "leakers". Vendors are of course free to choose with whom they cooperate in the future.
