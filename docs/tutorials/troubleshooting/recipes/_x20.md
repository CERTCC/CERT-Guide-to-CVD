    - Sometimes this is triggered by savvy marketing on the part of the Finder or Reporter
    - Other times this attention comes about because of recent similar media stories.
    - Often the media attention is disproportionate to the severity of the vulnerability.
    - Vendors and Coordinators (if any are involved) can often help their users, constituents, and the media to appropriately calibrate their concern about a vulnerability by providing a clear and accurate representation of the facts.
    - Vendors should not attempt to squash the information already available in the public sphere however. This often backfires, leading to even more publicity. It's better to let the vulnerability be the story rather than have the Vendor's response to the vulnerability become the story.
