!!! warning "Vendor stops responding"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation andprioritization, Remediation, Public Awareness

        **Description:**

        1. The reporter and vendor had already been in contact about the vulnerability.
        2. The reporter has repeatedly attempted to communicate with the vendor.
        3. The vendor has been non-responsive for at least two weeks
        4. Either of the following events has occurred: 
            1. An already-agreed embargo date has passed, or
            2. No embargo date was set and at least six weeks have elapsed since the vendor's last response.

    - see 6.3 Somebody Stops Replying.
    - At this point, the CERT/CC would consider the vendor to be non-responsive.
    - Assuming the reporter chooses to continue pursuing the issue at all, their options include:
        - The reporter may publish the report on their own. 
            - If so, the reporter should provide a courtesy copy of the report to the vendor with a few days' lead time to give the vendor one last chance to prepare for entering the Public Awareness phase.
        - The reporter may attempt to engage a coordinator
