    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter, Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation and prioritization, Remediation, Public Awareness

        **Description:**

        1. Multiple vendors are likely to be affected by the vulnerability.
        2. The reporter or Vendor(s) already involved are concerned about their ability to notify and coordinate other Vendors' response to the vulnerability.

    - See also Vulnerability affects downstream vendors as well as 5.4 Multiparty CVD, 5.5 Response Pacing and Synchronization, and 5.6 Maintaining Pre-Disclosure Secrecy
    - Reporters and Vendors can engage the services of a third party Coordinator to assist with notifying other Vendors, coordinating response along a supply chain, resolving disputes, etc.
    - Reporters and Vendors should consider shortening the embargo period for larger multiparty cases. The chance of embargo failure grows dramatically as more parties are added to the coordination.
