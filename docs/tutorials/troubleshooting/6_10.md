# Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Table 

The following table provides advice for resolving problems in various
CVD scenarios. It is organized according to the roles affected and the
phases in which the problem is likely to arise. Each problem identified
is accompanied by a description intended to help the reader diagnose the
problem. In addition to the advice found in the table below, we
encourage readers to be familiar with [6.9 What to Do When Things Go
Wrong](6_9.md) for more general advice.

- [Finder does not have the resources to shepherd a CVD case through to resolution](#01)
- [Evidence of exploitation for an embargoed report](#02)
- [Unable to engage vendor contact](#03)
- [Vendor does not have a posted bug bounty](#04)
- [Vendor has a reputation for or history of treating reporters poorly](#05)
- [Vendor stops responding](#06)
- [Vendor explicitly declines to take action on a report](#07)
- [Vendor is unprepared for pending embargo expiration](#08)
- [A CVD case involves too many vendors or is otherwise excessively complex.](#09)
- [Reporter stops responding](#10)
- [Vulnerability becomes public prior to vendor intended date](#11)
- [Vulnerability becomes public prior to vendor awareness of the vulnerability](#12)
- [Vendor receives report outside the scope of their reporting program](#13)
- [Vendor suspects the finder violated its policy in the process of finding a vulnerability.](#14)
- [Vendor receives second report of a vulnerability already under embargo](#15)
- [Vulnerability affects downstream vendors](#16)
- [Vulnerability affects unknown downstream vendors](#17)
- [Vulnerability affects multiple vendors with incompatible disclosure policies](#18)
- [Vendor is unprepared for pending embargo expiration](#19)
- [A vulnerability is receiving unanticipated media attention](#20)
