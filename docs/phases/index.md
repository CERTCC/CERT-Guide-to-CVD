-   **Discovery** -- A researcher (not necessarily an academic one)
    discovers a vulnerability by using one of numerous tools and
    processes.
-   **Reporting** -- A researcher submits a vulnerability report to a
    software or product vendor, or a third-party coordinator if
    necessary.
-   **Validation and Triage** -- The analyst validates the report to
    ensure accuracy before action can be taken and prioritizes reports
    relative to others.
-   **Remediation** -- A remediation plan (ideally a software patch, but
    could also be other mechanisms) is developed and tested.
-   **Public Awareness** -- The vulnerability and its remediation plan
    is disclosed to the public.
-   **Deployment** -- The remediation is applied to deployed systems.\
    \
