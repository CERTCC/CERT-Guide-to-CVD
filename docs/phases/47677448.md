# 1.3. Why Coordinate Vulnerability Disclosures? 








Vulnerability disclosures fall between two extremes:

1.  Disclose everything you know about a vulnerability to everyone as
    soon as you know it.
2.  Never disclose anything you know about a vulnerability to anyone.

Prior research into vulnerability disclosure practices \[1\] has shown
that neither approach is socially optimal. Thus, we are given to hope
that we can improve on these extremes by striking a balance in between.
But doing so requires several questions to be answered: how much
information should be released? To whom? And when? Do you wait for a
patch to be deployed before announcing the vulnerability\'s existence?
Do you wait for the patch to be available but not yet deployed? Is it
okay to acknowledge that you know of a vulnerability in a product
without providing any other details?

It\'s also important to consider that not all factors are within control
of the parties involved in the disclosure process. Adversaries can
discover vulnerabilities and use them to exploit vulnerable systems
regardless of your participation in a well-coordinated disclosure
process. And yet many vulnerabilities might never be exploited in
attacks. So how should we approach the question of potential harm and
the questions surrounding risk and reward of vulnerability disclosure?

The CERT/CC believes the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)
process provides a reasonable balance of these competing interests. The
public and especially users of vulnerable products deserve to be
informed about issues with those products and how the vendor handles
those issues. At the same time, disclosing such information without
review and mitigation only opens the public up to exploitation. The
ideal scenario occurs when everyone coordinates and cooperates to
protect the public. This coordination may also be turned into a public
relations win for the vendor by quickly addressing the issue, thereby
avoiding bad press for being unprepared.

Some vendors express concern about the negative attention brought by
having a long list of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in their
products. In our opinion, the number of vulnerabilities found in a
vendor\'s products is less valuable as an indicator of the vendor\'s
security stance than the consistency of its response to vulnerabilities
in a comprehensive and timely manner. In the end, the goal of CVD is to
help users make more informed decisions about actions they can take to
secure their systems.

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) \[2\], which
consists of many public and private organizations and companies involved
in vulnerability and security incident handling, has established a
Vulnerability Coordination Special Interest Group to develop some common
CVD best practices and guidelines \[3\]. While the existence of
individual vulnerabilities may be unexpected and surprising, these
common practices should help lead to fewer surprises for all
stakeholders in the CVD process itself.

Governments and international organizations also recognize the need for
coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices. In 2015, the Department
of Commerce\'s National Telecommunications and Information
Administration initiated a Multistakeholder Process for Cybersecurity
Vulnerabilities \[4\] to
