[In the past few years we\'ve witnessed the rise of branded
vulnerabilities: Heartbleed \[1\], Badlock \[2\], Shell Shock \[3\], and
GHOST \[4\]. Does having a marketing department behind a vulnerability
disclosure make that vulnerability worse than others without the
marketing push? Not in any technical sense, no. Instead, what it does is
draw additional attention to the vulnerability---so vendors can be
forced to adjust the priority of the vulnerability cases they\'re
working on and allocate resources toward addressing whatever
vulnerability is getting the hype. Are branded vulnerabilities good or
bad for internet security? The only good answer is the lesson of the
Taoist parable of the farmer and the horse: \"Maybe.\"

# The Streisand Effect {#id-6.8Hype,Marketing,andUnwantedAttention-TheStreisandEffect}

[Attempts to squash true information once it\'s been revealed tends not
only to spread the information more widely, but also to backfire on
whoever is trying to conceal it. The name comes from a case involving
the removal of online photos of a famous celebrity\'s house \[6\]. The
attempt to suppress the photos only drew attention to them resulting in
many more people seeing them than would have otherwise.\
\
This scenario comes up from time to time in CVD cases. Often it takes
the form of a vendor trying to suppress the publication of a report
about a vulnerability in its product, with some threat of legal action
if the information is released. As we\'ve discussed previously, the
knowledge that a vulnerability exists in some feature of a product can
be sufficient for a knowledgeable individual to rediscover the
vulnerability. The legal threats usually serve to amplify the discussion
of the case within the security community, which draws more attention to
the vendor and its products at the same time it demotivates reporters\'
willingness to participate in the CVD process. Even more problematic is
that when such attention comes to focus on the vendors\' products, it is
very likely that additional vulnerabilities will be found---while
simultaneously less likely that anyone will bother to report them to the
vendor before disclosing them publicly. Vendors should not underestimate
spite as a motivation for vulnerability
discovery.Â ]{style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;"}[\
