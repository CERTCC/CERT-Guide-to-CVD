[Vulnerability Analysis and Resolution](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/vulnerability-analysis-and-resolution-var-cert-rmm-process-area/){:target="_blank"}
(VAR) is an operational process
described within the [CERT Resilience Management Model](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/cert-resilience-management-model-cert-rmm-collection/){:target="_blank"}
(RMM) that closely overlaps with the concept of
Vulnerability Management. Although the RMM is designed with a focus on
operational resilience for organizations, there is sufficient overlap
with our topic that it's worth highlighting here. Within the RMM's VAR
process area, a number of goals and practices are identified:

- Prepare for Vulnerability Analysis and Resolution.
- Establish Scope -- The assets and operational environments that must
be examined for vulnerabilities are identified.
- Establish a Vulnerability Analysis and Resolution Strategy.
- Establish and maintain a process for identifying and analyzing
vulnerabilities.
- Identify Sources of Vulnerability Information.
- Discover Vulnerabilities.
- Analyze Vulnerabilities to determine whether they need to be reduced
or eliminated.
- Manage Exposure to Vulnerabilities -- Strategies are developed and
implemented to manage exposure to identified vulnerabilities.
- Identify Root Causes -- The root causes of vulnerabilities are
examined to improve vulnerability analysis and resolution and reduce
organizational exposure. Perform review of identified
vulnerabilities to determine and address underlying causes.
