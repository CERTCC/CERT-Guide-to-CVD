# CVD Quick Start

This is the Quick Start meta-guide for the *CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure* (CVD).

[The *CERT Guide to CVD* in a Nutshell](../tutorials/cvd_in_a_nutshell.md) contains an
overview of the entire document, and is a good place for all readers to
become familiar with what's in the guide without necessarily poring
over the details. Where you go from there depends on what you're trying
to achieve.

- :material-magnify:  **Finders**, :material-message-alert: **Reporters**, :material-code-braces: **Vendors**,  and :material-arrow-decision: **Coordinators**

    ---

    If you're a [*researcher*](../topics/roles/finder.md),
    [*vendor*](../topics/roles/vendor.md), or [*coordinator*](../topics/roles/coordinator.md) trying to coordinate a disclosure and you need help, you might
    want to start with
    [Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](../howto/coordination/cvd_recipes.md)
    to find the problem area(s) you're currently dealing with.
    From there you can follow the links into the document for more details.

- :material-code-braces: **Vendor PSIRTs**

    ---

    If you're a [*vendor*](../topics/roles/vendor.md) trying to establish a vendor product security
    incident response team (PSIRT), you may be interested in
    [Principles](../topics/principles/index.md),
    [Preparation](../howto/preparation/index.md), and
    [Operation](../howto/operation/index.md)
    as starting points. Additionally, you can use
    [Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](../howto/coordination/cvd_recipes.md)
    as a rubric of scenarios to consider when planning your operational processes.
    [Disclosure Policy Resources](../reference/policy_templates/index.md)
    contains links to a number of disclosure policy examples and
    templates.

- :material-arrow-decision: **Coordinators**

    ---

    If you're a [*coordinator*](../topics/roles/coordinator.md) spinning up your CVD capability, you
    should become familiar with the
    [Principles](../topics/principles/index.md),
    [Roles](../topics/roles/index.md),
    [Coordination](../howto/coordination/index.md),
    and
    [Operation](../howto/operation/index.md) sections.
    The [Reference](../reference/index.md) section may also be useful to you.

- :octicons-people-16: **Policy-Makers**

    ---

    If you're a *policy-maker* (or influencer thereof), the
    sections
    [HowTo Overview](../howto/index.md),
    [Principles](../topics/principles/index.md),
    [Roles](../topics/roles/index.md),
    and [Phases](../topics/phases/index.md) are probably most useful to you
    to start, but there are many edge cases in
    [Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](../howto/coordination/cvd_recipes.md)
    that are worth considering when you're thinking about writing policy
    that sets out how things are expected to be done.
    [Disclosure Policy Resources](../reference/policy_templates/index.md)
    contains links to a number of disclosure policy examples and
    templates.

Of course, we think it's best if you eventually become familiar with
the entire site, but hopefully the hints above will help you find
the most effective places to start.
