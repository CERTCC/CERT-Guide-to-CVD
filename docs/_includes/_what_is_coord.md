        The CERT/CC's security advisories are known as [*Vulnerability Notes*](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls).

    Coordination is the process by which multiple parties coordinate to
    share information regarding a vulnerability, with the goal of producing
    a patch which fixes the vulnerability. Usually, the patch is accompanied
    by a security advisory, which provides the public with information on
    the vulnerability and how to apply the patch. However, in some cases,
    the security advisory may be released before a patch is available. 
    This process at times involves several organizations.

    The CERT/CC
    [coordinates](../tutorials/coord_certcc/index.md)
    vulnerabilities with
    [vendors](../tutorials/coord_certcc/vendor.md),
    as well as provides assistance to vulnerability
    [reporters](../tutorials/coord_certcc/reporter.md)
    wishing to begin the coordination process for their own vulnerability.
