!!! question "Who is a Vendor?"

    As software-centric systems find their way into various industries, more
    and more vendors of traditional products find themselves becoming
    software vendors. 
    Moving beyond traditional software companies, recent years have seen the
    rise in networked products and services from a variety of industries,
    including those below:

    - consumer products, such as home automation and the internet of
    things (IoT)
    - internet service providers (ISPs) and the makers of devices that
    access ISP services: internet modems, routers, access points, and
    the like
    - mobile phone manufacturers and service providers
    - mobile application developers
    - industrial control systems, building automation, HVAC manufacturers
    - infrastructure suppliers and increasingly "smart" utility services
    including water and sewer services and the energy industry
    - transportation services, including the airline and automotive
    industries
    - medical devices and health-related device manufacturers
    - financial services, including banks, credit card companies
    - cloud service providers
    - artificial intelligence and machine learning software and service providers
    
    Any company or organization that provides a product or service that relies on a
    computer or software is referred to as a
    *vendor*,
    even if that organization doesn't directly make the computer or software
    components used by their products.
