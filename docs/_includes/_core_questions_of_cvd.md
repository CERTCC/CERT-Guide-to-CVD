!!! question "The Core Questions of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure"

    CVD participants can be thought of as repeatedly asking these questions:
    
    1.  What actions should I take in response to this knowledge?
    2.  Who else needs to know what, and when?

    The CVD process continues until the answers to these questions are
    _nothing_, and _nobody_.
