# CVD Platform Interoperability

<!-- 

Everybody has their own platform. Can they interact? Are we doomed to email as the greatest common factor?

Solution looks like APIs and message formats. 

Formats cover both syntax and semantics.
Semantics will be important. We don't always mean the same things even when we use the same words. (Undetected homograph problems.)

Authentication, identity, and authorization will be significant factors. Identity of individual humans. Identity of organizations. Relationships between organizations. Different individuals in various roles. A developer might work on lots of open source projects in addition to their day job at a vendor. What expectations are there for sharing?

Group management will be an issue. Are groups local to a specific organization? Can they be shared? Is my ``Unix'' peer the same as your redhat + hp + ibm + apple (no?) and how can we tell?

Membership -- employees move around. What expectations are there for use of personal accounts vs org-managed ones?
