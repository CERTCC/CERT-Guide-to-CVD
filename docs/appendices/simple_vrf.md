# Appendix C - Sample Vulnerability Report Form 

This is a vulnerability report, typically sent from a reporter to a
vendor. These reports may also be shared among other third parties, by

This is a report example based on the CERT/CC's [Vulnerability
Reporting Form](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/report/), and is not meant to be exhaustive of all possibilities.
