# Appendix D - Sample Vulnerability Disclosure Document 

The vulnerability disclosure document is also often referred to as a
"security advisory," particularly if published by the vendor.

This is an example of a vulnerability disclosure document based on
CERT/CC's [Vulnerability
Notes](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) format. It is not meant to be exhaustive of all
scenarios.

Please modify the sections and format as necessary to better suit your
needs.
