# Active Exploitation

If evidence comes to light that a vulnerability is being exploited in
the wild, that is usually a strong indication to accelerate the
disclosure timeline.

!!! tip "Active Exploitation Should Accelerate Disclosure"

    Active exploitation is indicative of either [independent discovery](./independent_discovery.md) or an
    [information leak](./leaks.md) from the CVD process (whether intentional or
    accidental), with the added concern that not only does an adversary know
    about the vulnerability but is already using it.

    Hence, in the case of known exploitation, it's usually best to consider
    disclosing what is known about the vulnerability&mdash;hopefully with some
    mitigation instructions&mdash;as soon as possible even if a patch is not yet
    available. From the vendor's standpoint, acknowledging that you're
    already aware of the vulnerability and are working on a fix can help
    restore users' confidence in your product and the process that produced
    it.
