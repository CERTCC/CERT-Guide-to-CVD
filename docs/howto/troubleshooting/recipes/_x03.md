!!! warning "Unable to engage vendor contact"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter
        
        **Phase(s):** Reporting

        **Description:**
        
        1. The reporter wishes to report a vulnerability to the vendor
        2. The reporter has been unable to find a way to contact the vendor
    
    - Assuming the reporter chooses to continue pursuing the issue at all, their options include:

        - The reporter may publish the report on their own. Hard-to-reach vendors often become less so after a vulnerability or two is made public without their involvement.
        - The reporter may attempt to engage a coordinator, to continue trying to reach the vendor

    - See [Find Vendor Contact](../../find_vendor_contact), [Reporting](../../topics/phases/reporting.md) and [Unresponsive Vendor](unresponsive_vendor.md).
