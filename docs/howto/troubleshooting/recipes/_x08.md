!!! warning "Vendor is unprepared for pending embargo expiration"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter, Coordinator

        **Phase(s):** Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. The Vendor is aware of the vulnerability.
        2. The embargo date is approaching.
        3. The Vendor communicates that it is not ready yet.

    - Reporters and Coordinators should consider the Vendor's responsiveness to date when deciding how to respond.
    - If the Vendor is cooperative and seems to have a reasonable explanation for the delay, extending the embargo may be preferable.
    - If the Vendor has had ample time to address the problem and does not appear to be acting in good faith toward a timely resolution, Reporters may choose to publish the vulnerability information on their own without the Vendor's participation. Alternatively, Reporters may choose to engage the services of a Coordinator to try to resolve the conflict.
    - In no case is it necessary for the Reporter or Coordinators to wait indefinitely for a Vendor that does not appear to be making progress toward timely resolution.
    - See [Disclosure Timing](../../../howto/variation/disclosure_timing.md) for more information on this topic.
