# Relationships that Go Sideways

CVD is a human coordination process, and humans are complicated.
They have feelings, and those feelings can get hurt.
People get frustrated, angry, and sometimes just have bad days.
And sometimes, they just don't get along.

<!--start-->When relationships go sideways in a CVD process, it can be a real problem.
The process can stall, or worse, the vulnerability can be disclosed in a way that is harmful to users.<!--end-->

!!! tip "The Human Element"

    The first thing to do when things appear to be going awry in a CVD case
    is to give people some slack to make mistakes.


!!! tip "Transparency, Consistency, and Simplicity"

    The more transparent your process is&mdash;and the closer it is to what
    other folks are doing&mdash;the better you will be able to avoid problems.

    Transparency is a key element of a successful CVD process.
    Good documentation is a start, but documenting a byzantine process
    isn't as useful as simplifying the process and then documenting that!
