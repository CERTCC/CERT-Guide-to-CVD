# Disclosure Timing

How long is "long enough" to respond to a vulnerability?
As with so many questions that arise in the CVD process, there is no
single right answer.

!!! question "How long is long enough?"

    Is 45 days long enough? Is 90 days too short? Is 217 days unreasonable? Three
    years? 
    The only answer we can give is "It depends."

    <!--start-->Complicated vulnerabilities usually take longer to fix.
    Larger cases involving more parties, more products, or more complex
    supply chains also tend to take longer to resolve, even if the
    vulnerabilities themselves are relatively simple.<!--end-->

So rather than trying to solve an underspecified problem, let's have a look at some of the factors that tend
to play into timing choices. This will give us an opportunity to see where some of the variability comes from.

!!! tip "Conference Schedules Often Drive Disclosure Timing"

    Conference schedules often drive researcher timelines. 
    There is a rhythmic cycle to the vulnerability disclosure calendar.
    [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/){:target="_blank"} and [DEF CON](https://www.defcon.org/){:target="_blank"} happen in early August every year.
    [Usenix Security](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/108){:target="_blank"} is usually right after that. The [RSA Conference](https://www.rsaconference.com/){:target="_blank"}
    is in the late winter or early spring. [CanSecWest](https://cansecwest.com/){:target="_blank"} is in the
    spring. Smaller conferences are scattered in between.

        Autumn: Black Hat Middle East/Africa
        Winter: Black Hat Europe
    ```

    Many of these
    conferences rely on presenters describing novel attack methods in
    varying degrees of detail. However, in order for researchers to analyze,
    develop, and demonstrate those techniques, vulnerabilities are often
    uncovered in extant products. That means that coordinating the
    disclosure of the vulnerabilities they've found is a common part of the
    conference preparation process for presenters. The CERT/CC often
    observes an increased rate of vulnerability reports a few months in
    advance of these conferences. Vendors would do well to be aware of these
    schedules and be prepared to respond quickly and appropriately to
    seemingly inflexible deadlines for
    disclosure.

!!! warning "Vendor Reputation and Willingness to Cooperate"

    Vendors that are perceived to treat vulnerability reporters poorly or
    that are perceived to be slow or unresponsive may find themselves being
    left to discover reports of vulnerabilities in their products at the
    same time as the public becomes aware of them. CVD is a social process,
    remember? And the game is played over and over, by players who share
    knowledge between rounds.

!!! tip "Declarative Disclosure Policies Reduce Uncertainty"

    [Avoiding surprise](../../topics/principles/avoid_surprise.md) is one of
    the principles of CVD. 
    To that end, explicitly declared policies (from both researchers and
    vendors) are a good thing. Expected disclosure timing is an important
    question to ask whenever a report is received. Sometimes the reporter or
    coordinator acting on the reporter's behalf has a standing policy of X
    days with no exceptions. Other reporters may be more flexible. If in
    doubt, ask.

## Diverting from the Plan

Plans are one thing, but reality sometimes disagrees with our assessment
of it. Breaking a previous disclosure timeline agreement is sometimes
necessary when events warrant. Below we cover a few reasons to release
earlier or later than planned.

!!! example "Reasons to release early"

    - Evidence of active exploitation
    - Vendor fails to respond, is not acting in good faith, or denies the
    existence of a vulnerability
    - Vulnerability is known to be discovered by adversaries, so the race
    to defend vulnerable systems is more focused
    - All known users have been notified and patched (usually via private
    channels)

!!! example "Reasons to hold back release"

    - Vendor not ready with fix, but continuing to make progress and is
    acting in good faith
    - Vulnerabilities with severe impact, especially those affecting
    safety-critical or critical infrastructure
    - Cases where new information is found late in the process, for
    example that there are important but previously unrecognized
    dependencies that alter the impact of the vulnerability or patch
    deployability

In cases that divert from the planned disclosure date, it sometimes
helps to seek the opinion of a neutral third party for advice on how to
proceed. Finders, reporters, and vendors can each have valid yet
conflicting perspectives on what the best course of action might be.
Coordinator organizations are often able to help resolve conflicts by
taking a neutral approach to the situation and advising one or more
parties in light of their prior experience.

!!! warning "All Disclosure Agreements Are Contingent"

    When vendors, reporters, and/or coordinators negotiate and agree to a
    release timeline for a vulnerability, they may behave as if they've
    reached some state of d√©tente with the world. But that's an illusion.
    True, they may have reached an agreement with each other, but it ignores
    another relevant role in the disclosure process: the adversary.

    Adversaries do not care whether the vendor plans to release the patch in
    a month, whether they need more time to test it prior to release,
    whether the reporter wants to break the news at a conference event,
    whether the reporter hopes to get paid for the work, or any other reason
    that reporters and vendors may have for agreeing to the terms they came
    to. 
    
    Furthermore, because the vulnerability's existence is an observable
    fact in the world, anyone else who happens to notice it might also
    choose to disclose that knowledge on their own terms without being party
    to any existing embargo agreements.
    
    Therefore it's important for
    vendors, reporters, and coordinators alike to recognize that all
    disclosure embargo agreements are necessarily contingent on
    circumstances beyond the control of the parties involved; and that those
    circumstances are not simply random events but may be controlled by
    actors who are indifferent to their concerns. 

!!! warning "Releasing Partial Information Can Help Adversaries"

    When considering what information to release about a vulnerability, our
    advice is "Don't tease." Our experience shows that the mere knowledge
    of a vulnerability's existence in a feature of some product is
    sufficient for a skillful person to discover it for themselves. Rumor of
    a vulnerability draws attention from knowledgeable people with
    vulnerability finding skills&mdash;and there's no guarantee that all those
    people will have users' best interests in mind. Thus, teasing the
    existence of a vulnerability in a product can sometimes provide an
    adversarial advantage that increases risk to end users.
