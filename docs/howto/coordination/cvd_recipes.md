# Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure  

<!--start-->We have compiled a list of common problems that can arise during the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process.
Each problem identified is accompanied by a description intended to help the reader diagnose the problem.<!--end-->
The list is organized according to the roles affected and the phases in which the problem is likely to arise.

In addition to the advice found below, we encourage readers to be familiar with our [General Tips](./general_tips.md).
