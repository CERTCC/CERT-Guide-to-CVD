        Like a recipe card, each item includes an _ingredients_ list that describes
    
        - the _roles_ affected
        - the _phases_ in which the problem is likely to arise
        - the _problem_ itself

    In this edition of the Guide, we have organized our problem solving advice into a set of recipe cards.

    The _recipe_ portion of each card provides a set of instructions for resolving the problem.
    These aren't necessarily step-by-step instructions, but rather a set of guidelines to help you navigate the problem.
