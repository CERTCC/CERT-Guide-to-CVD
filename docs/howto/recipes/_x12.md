!!! warning "Vulnerability becomes public prior to vendor awareness of the vulnerability"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Reporting

        **Description:**

        1. The vendor was unaware of the vulnerability at the time it became public.

    - The main defenses Vendors have against being surprised by public reports of vulnerabilities in their products are:
        - Vendors should have a mechanism for receiving vulnerability reports and a process for resolving them
        - Vendors should strive to maintain a reputation for cooperating with Finders and Reporters
        - Vendors should design, evaluate, and test their own products as extensively as they are able to.
    - See [Disclosure Timing](../disclosure_timing.md), [Intentional or Accidental Leaks](../leaks.md), and [Independent Discovery](../independent_discovery.md) for more information on this topic.
