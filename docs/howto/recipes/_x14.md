!!! warning "Vendor suspects the finder violated its policy in the process of finding a vulnerability."

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation and prioritization, Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. Vendor received report.
        2. Vendor's analysis indicates that other policies were violated in the discovery process.

    - There are two issues at hand in this case:
        1. Is there a vulnerability that the vendor needs to respond to?
        2. Do the finder's actions constitute a security incident?
    - Answering the first question in the affirmative, the vendor should proceed as normal through the remediation and public awareness phases.
    - If the finder's actions are determined to qualify as a security incident of their own, the vendor would do well to consider the implied beneficence on the part of the reporter in providing the report to the vendor in the first place. Yes, rules may have been broken, but sometimes an _All's Well that Ends Well_ response is preferable.
        - Gently reminding the reporter of the vendor's expectations can help solidify a positive relationship between the vendor and the research community.
    - That said, the above advice should not be construed as a recommendation that vendors acquiesce to aggression or abuse from finders or reporters.
