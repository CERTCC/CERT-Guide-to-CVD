!!! warning "Vendor is unprepared for pending embargo expiration"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. The Vendor is aware of the vulnerability.
        2. The embargo date is approaching.
        3. The Vendor is not ready yet.

    - If the Vendor is working toward a solution but needs more time to complete its analysis, development, or testing, it can request an extension of the embargo from the Reporter and/or Coordinator (if any).
    - Vendors should recognize that (absent any binding agreement to the contrary) the embargo is a courtesy offered by the Reporter or Coordinator to the Vendor, but that Reporter or Coordinator policy or other considerations may supersede the Vendor's desire for more time.
