# How to Coordinate Vulnerability Disclosures

This section provides guidance for folks who are actively engaged in Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)
and are looking for advice on how to handle specific situations.
We have organized it roughly in the order that you might encounter these problems,
although we're not strictly adhering to the [Phases](../topics/phases) we've outlined in the [Understanding CVD](../topics/index.md) section.

!!! note "How to Use This Section"

    Each page is intended to be a standalone resource, allowing you to directly access the advice you need.
    This means that some of the advice may be repeated across pages, but we try to cross-reference where possible.
  
    The navigation on the left side of the page is organized by topic, consistent with the structure of this page.
    Where necessary, navigation within each page is also provided in the right-hand column.
    You can use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page to move through the advice in sequence.
