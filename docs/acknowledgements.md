The material in the CERTÂ® Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
inherits from 29 years of analyzing vulnerabilities and navigating
vulnerability disclosure issues at the CERT Coordination Center
(CERT/CC). While a few of us may be the proximate authors of the words
you are reading, many of the ideas these words represent have been
bouncing around at CERT for years in one brain or another. We'd like to
acknowledge those who contributed their part to this endeavor, whether
knowingly or not:
