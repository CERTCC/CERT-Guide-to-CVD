# 6.10 Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Table 








The following table provides advice for resolving problems in various
CVD scenarios. It is organized according to the roles affected and the
phases in which the problem is likely to arise. Each problem identified
is accompanied by a description intended to help the reader diagnose the
problem. In addition to the advice found in the table below, we
encourage readers to be familiar with [6.9 What to Do When Things Go
Wrong](6.9-What-to-Do-When-Things-Go-Wrong_47677491.md) for more
general advice.
