!!! warning "Vendor receives second report of a vulnerability already under embargo"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Vendor

        **Phase(s):** Reporting, Validation and Triage,Remediation

        **Description:**

        1. The vendor had received a report of a vulnerability
        2. The vendor received a second, seemingly independent, report of the same vulnerability

    - Vulnerability rediscovery is known to happen. It's usually not a big deal if the Reporters are cooperating with the Vendor.
    - Vendors should attempt to verify that the second report is in fact independent of the first, and not simply a case of the same report taking diverse paths to reach the vendor.
    - Vendors should re-evaluate any existing embargo and consider accelerating the Remediation and Public Awareness phases in light of the apparent ease with which the vulnerability is being independently found.
    - Vendors should ensure any relevant bug bounty policies define how this situation will be handled with respect to bounty payouts.
    - If the second report is made in public rather than directly to the vendor, see also _Vulnerability becomes public prior to vendor intended date_.
