        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter
        
        **Phase(s):** Reporting

        **Description:**
        
        1. The reporter wishes to report a vulnerability to the vendor
        2. The reporter has been unable to find a way to contact the vendor
    
    - See 4.2 Reporting for tips on how to reach vendors. See also 6.1 Unable to Find Vendor Contact and 6.2 Unresponsive Vendor.
    - Assuming the reporter chooses to continue pursuing the issue at all, their options include:
    - The reporter may publish the report on their own. Hard-to-reach vendors often become less so after a vulnerability or two is made public without their involvement.
    - The reporter may attempt to engage a coordinator, to continue trying to reach the vendor
