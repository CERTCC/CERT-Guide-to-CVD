!!! warning "Vendor has a reputation for or history of treating reporters poorly"

    !!! warning inline end ""

        **Role(s) affected:** Reporter

        **Phase(s):** Reporting

        **Description:**

        1. The reporter wishes to report a vulnerability to the vendor
        2. The vendor has a history of treating reporters poorly (retaliation, threatened litigation, etc.)

    - Assuming the reporter chooses to continue pursuing the issue at all, their options include:
        - The Reporter may publish the report on their own, possibly anonymously.
        - The Reporter may attempt to engage a Coordinator to act as a neutral third party
        - The Reporter may attempt to engage a Coordinator to act as an anonymizing proxy to relay the information to the Vendor
        - The Reporter may take steps to report the vulnerability to the Vendor anonymously.
    - The CERT/CC recommends that Reporters do their best to provide Vendors with an opportunity to resolve vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure. However if the Vendor's prior behavior makes that infeasible it's our opinion that there is a benefit to public awareness of the vulnerability regardless.
