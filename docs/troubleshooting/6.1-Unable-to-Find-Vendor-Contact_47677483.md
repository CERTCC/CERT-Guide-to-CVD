# 6.1 Unable to Find Vendor Contact 








Any number of factors can lead to difficulty in making the initial
connection between a would-be reporter and the party or parties that can
do something about the vulnerability they want to report. Sometimes
products outlive vendors. This can even happen in open source projects
where the code is still out there but the team that built it has
scattered to the winds. Companies go bankrupt. People change jobs. Maybe
Vendor A included a library from Vendor B, who licensed it from C, but
they only got a binary executable and didn\'t get the source code; and
Vendor C is a spinoff of a conglomerate going through bankruptcy
proceedings in a different country where they don\'t speak your
language. Things can get complicated.
