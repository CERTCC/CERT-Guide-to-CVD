# Troubleshooting CVD 

*Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not
watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily
in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you
want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you're doing the
process right. Gulp. It's not that rare to hear a junior leader defend
a bad outcome with something like, "Well, we followed the process." A
more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and
improve the process. The process is not the thing. It's always worth
asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?*

As we've mentioned throughout this documentation, CVD can occasionally be a
complex process. In this section, we'll first cover some of the common
ways things can go wrong and finish with some suggestions on what to do
if and when they do. A summary of the advice in this section can be
found in [6.10 Troubleshooting Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
