We\'ll repeat it again here because it\'s so important: the participants
in CVD are humans. They have feelings, and those feelings can get hurt.
People get frustrated, angry, and sometimes just have bad days.

The first thing to do when things appear to be going awry in a CVD case
is to give people some slack to make mistakes.

The more transparent your process is---and the closer it is to what
other folks are doing---the better you will be able to avoid problems.
Good documentation is a start, but documenting a byzantine process
isn\'t as useful as simplifying the process and then documenting that!
