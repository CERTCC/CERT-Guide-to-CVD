In most cases, that shouldn't matter, because:</p><ul><li>If the report is for a vulnerability that the vendor is able to fix, the vendor should proceed with the rest of the CVD process as if it were in scope</li><li>If the report is for a vulnerability that the vendor is unable to fix (e.g., it's not in the vendor's product but in a library) the vendor may redirect the reporter to the originating vendor, or could act as a coordinator and engage the upstream vendor directly.</li><li>If the report is not for a vulnerability but represents a security incident (e.g., data leaked on an open server), the vendor can handle it as a security incident.</li><li>If the report is for a bug that is otherwise not a vulnerability, the vendor can route the report to the appropriate developers for remediation.</li></ul><p>In each of these cases, the reporter has provided useful information that is actionable by the vendor. Misdirected (out of scope) reports provide vendors an opportunity to review and revise their published documentation and policies to ensure they're communicating clearly what they do and do not expect to receive via their CVD program.</p><p>Even if the report indicates that the finder or reporter went far beyond the vendor's policy, it may still be appropriate to handle the report as if it were in compliance in order to avoid causing further problems for either the vendor or the reporter. Reporters can often be redirected toward acceptable future behavior if their initial oversteps are treated as teachable moments rather than violations in need of punishment.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><h5 id="id-6.10TroubleshootingCoordinatedVulnerabilityDisclosureTable-Vendorsuspectsthefinderviolateditspolicyintheprocessoffindingavulnerability.">Vendor suspects the finder violated its policy in the process of finding a vulnerability.</h5></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd">Vendor</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p>Reporting</p><p>Validation and Triage</p><p>Remediation</p></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><ol><li>Vendor received report.</li><li>Vendor's analysis indicates that other policies were violated in the discovery process.</li></ol></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p>There are two issues at hand in this case:</p><ol><li>Is there a vulnerability that the vendor needs to respond to?</li><li>Do the finder's actions constitute a security incident?</li></ol><p>Answering the first question in the affirmative, the vendor should proceed as normal through the remediation and public awareness phases.</p><p>If the finder's actions are determined to qualify as a security incident of their own, the vendor would do well to consider the implied beneficence on the part of the reporter in providing the report to the vendor in the first place.
