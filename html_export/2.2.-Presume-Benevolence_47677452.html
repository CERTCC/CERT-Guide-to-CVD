                    <p>Benevolence refers to the morally valuable character trait or virtue of being inclined to act to benefit others. In terms of the CVD process, we have found that it is usually best to assume that any individual who has taken the time and effort to reach out to a vendor or a coordinator to report an issue is likely benevolent and sincerely wishes to reduce the risk posed by the vulnerability. While each reporter may have secondary motives (such as those listed in Table 1 below), and may even be difficult to work with at times, allowing negative associations about a CVD participants' motives to accumulate can color your language and discussions with them.</p><p>This isn't to say you should maintain your belief that researcher is acting in good faith when presented with evidence to the contrary. Rather, one should keep in mind that participants are working toward a common goal: reducing the harm caused by deployed insecure systems.
