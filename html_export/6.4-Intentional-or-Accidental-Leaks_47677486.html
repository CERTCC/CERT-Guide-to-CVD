                    <p>Sometimes information leaks out of the CVD process. Perhaps an email gets CC'ed to someone who didn't need to know. Somebody might talk too much at a conference. Somebody could tweet that they just found a vulnerability in product X, providing no other details. Somebody might intentionally disclose the information to someone not involved in the supply chain for the fix.</p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone plays by the same rules. You might find information you thought was shared in confidence showing up in some non-confidential location. It might be a simple misunderstanding, mismatched expectations, or in rare cases, a malicious act. Regardless of how it leaked, there are three major questions to ask:</p><ol><li>What information leaked?</li><li>How did the information leak?</li><li>How will you respond?</li></ol><p>As we noted in <a href="5.7-Disclosure-Timing_47677481.html">Section 5.7</a>, mere knowledge that a vulnerability exists in a certain component can sometimes be enough to enable a determined individual or organization to find it. While a partial leak of information isn't necessarily as serious as a detailed leak, it should at least trigger additional consideration of accelerating the disclosure timeline.</p><p><br/></p><div class="panel" style="border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelContent">
