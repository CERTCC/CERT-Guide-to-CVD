                    <p>Horst W.J. Rittel and Melvin M. Webber, in their 1973 article &quot;Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning,&quot; describe the following characteristics of <em>wicked problems</em> [1]:</p><ol><li>&quot;<strong>There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem</strong>&quot; – solving the problem is analogous to understanding it.</li><li>&quot;<strong>Wicked problems have no stopping rule</strong>&quot; – the problem has no intrinsic criteria to indicate that a solution is sufficient; solutions depend rather on the planner deciding to stop planning.</li><li>&quot;<strong>Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad</strong>&quot; – the judgement of a solution's fitness by parties involved will be filtered through their values and their predisposed ideology. These judgements are usually &quot;expressed as 'good' or 'bad' or, more likely, as 'better or worse' or 'satisfying' or 'good enough.'&quot;</li><li>&quot;<strong>There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem</strong>&quot; – solutions can have far<strong>-</strong>reaching and not always clear effects in both time and scope. Likewise, the desirability of the outcomes may not become clear until much later.</li><li>&quot;<strong>Every solution to a wicked problem is a 'one-shot operation'; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly</strong>&quot; – actions taken in response to the problem affect the options available to future solutions.</li><li>&quot;<strong>Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan</strong>&quot; – it is not possible to demonstrate that all possible solutions have been considered or even identified.</li><li>&quot;<strong>Every wicked problem is essentially unique</strong>&quot; – The meaning of <em>essentially unique</em> is given as &quot;despite long lists of similarities between a current problem and a previous one, there always might be an additional distinguishing property that is of overriding importance.&quot;</li><li>&quot;<strong>Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem</strong>&quot; – every identified cause leads to a &quot;higher level&quot; problem of which the current problem is a symptom. As a result, incremental approaches or marginal improvements may have little or no impact on the problem.</li><li>&quot;<strong>The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem</strong>'<strong>s resolution</strong>&quot; – The way a problem is described influences the solutions proposed.</li><li>&quot;<strong>The planner has no right to be wrong</strong>&quot; – The goal of a solution is not to find an ultimate truth about the world, rather it is to improve conditions for those who inhabit it.</li></ol><p>We assert that vulnerability disclosure can be thought of as a wicked problem, offering this document as evidence to that effect.</p><p><br/></p><div class="panel" style="border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelContent">
